# PiTV Alpha V0.1

## Major Update
 This project has just been updated with new features, big fixes, and a new name. The new name for this project is PiTV. It is currenty in Alpha with Version 0.1. This update brings a new feature: Update Checking. Everytime the program runs a command it will make a quick request to the github respoity version.txt file and make sure it matches the current version available on github. If not it will ask you to update PiTV. This version also brings a fix to allow the program to return a string. This means the shortcuts will no longer hang thus, breaking some key functionality. With this new version and new name brings a new install script. Some functionality from the install script has been removed since it did not function properly. I will add this feature back and make sure it works. I also hope to eventually add more tv streaming services.
