# Raspberry Pi Smart TV ALPHA

## Major Upate Coming
Within the next few days I plan on releasing a full re-write and to transition the project over to Java 8 instead of Python 3. I am deciding to trasnition the program since I understand Java better and will be able to quickly add new features and bug fixes. The new update will have all the same features as the current version and possibly new features as well. Stay on the lookout. Also please DO NOT use the current version it is no longer supported.
