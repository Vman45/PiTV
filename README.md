# PiTV Beta V0.3

## Version 0.3
 This version is a major update!! I have added support for music streaming services. To see a full list of all supported services scroll to the 'Currently Supported Streaming Services Section'. I have also removed some extra code. Also have re-worked how requests are handled. With that last point, the current public Siri Shortcut no longer works with this new version. I will post a new Siri Shortuct ASAP.

## Want a video tutorial?
 I plan on starting to upload video tutorials on how to install and use PiTV. I will upload them on this youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7qJshvWhYX0Nx1qrI3eu1Q/ 
 I will post an update here whenever I upload a tutorial.

## Version 0.2
 In this version I have improved reliability and added support for the first public Siri Shortcut. Directions to setup and install down below.

## Major Update
 This project has just been updated with new features, big fixes, and a new name. The new name for this project is PiTV. It is currenty in Alpha with Version 0.1. This update brings a new feature: Update Checking. Everytime the program runs a command it will make a quick request to the github respoity version.txt file and make sure it matches the current version available on github. If not it will ask you to update PiTV. This version also brings a fix to allow the program to return a string. This means the shortcuts will no longer hang thus, breaking some key functionality. With this new version and new name brings a new install script. Some functionality from the install script has been removed since it did not function properly. I will add this feature back and make sure it works. I also hope to eventually add more tv streaming services.

 2. Click Get Shortcut
 3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Add Untrusted Shortcut
 4. Once downloaded you need to edit the shortcut by clicking the 3 dots in the upper right hand corner
 5. Once on that page change the url inside the dictionary to the url of your raspberry pi.
 6. Run the shortcut by clicking on it or saying "Binge Youtube"
 
 ## Get the full Experience 
  To get the full experience it is recommended that you use the full install script listed above and to download the Unified Remote iOS app onto your device.

 ## Current Limitations
 The only officially supported user-friendly activation method is using Siri Shortcuts. Another way of activation is to use Postman to make GET and POST requests to the server. More activation methods on the way.
 
 ## Features to come
 - Improvements to shortcuts and the ability to get responses
 - Possible web UI
 - âœ“ Update checker
 - Video tutorials
 - Easy and quick update script
 - More user friendly activation methods ie Google Assistant, IFTTT, Alexa
 - Adding audio streaming services
