# Raspberry Pi Smart TV ALPHA

## About this project
 The purpose of this project is to allow the raspberry pi to function as a smart tv. The final project will allow a user to speak to any major voice assistant and will run a command on the raspberry pi to pull up any show or movie on any major streaming service.
 
 ## Supported Streaming Services
  - Youtube (Subscriptions and searching)
  - All services on JustWatch
  - Steam Link (Gaming Streaming)
  - Xfinity Stream
 
 ## Current Limitations
 Currently, the program doesn't have an easy way to install and get all the dependencies downloaded easily. Also when using Sir Shortcuts(currently only support activation method) shortcuts don't return response when running commands and timeout.
 
 ## Features to come
 - Easy install script with dependencies
 - Improvements to shortcuts and the ability to get responses
 - Possible web UI
 - Update checker
